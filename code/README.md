# FAQ

*What if I don't see an example in my preferred language?*

That's fine! We are language agnostic - the examples in this folder are written in some of the more popular data science-related languages, but you can write your code in whichever langauge you prefer. There are a few things to keep in mind:

- Make sure your file is named in the format "firstnamelastname_code.extension"
- Make sure you thoroughly comment your code so it is easy to understand. Remember, submissions may be shared around the world!
- Make sure you include necessary attributions if you use portions of someone else's code.
